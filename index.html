														<p>
															I was hired by Smoky Mountain Jeep Invasion to help them create a website used to sell event tickets and merchandise. I did this as a freelance web developer.
														</p>
														<p>
															Much of my time working for Jeep Invasion was spent working on the backend of their site which I set up using NodeJS and the SquareAPI to handle user transactions. 
														</p>
														<p>
															While working for Jeep Invasion I:
														</p>
														<ul class="list-style">
															<li>Built the front-end of the website based off of the client requested design</li>
															<li>developed the back-end e-commerce system to facilitate user transactions and user management</li>
															<li>Worked with the client to increase website traffic and sales through search engine optimization techniques</li>
														</ul>
													</div>
													<p>
														Since building this site, the company has decided to transfer to a simpler non-code based site due to upkeep costs.

													<div class="blog-content">
														<h1>What is CodeTN?</h1>
														<p>
															CodeTN is an annual competition comprised of a six-month process where students work closely with their classmates, a TechPro, and their class sponsor to plan, design, and code their own dynamic web application, in the hope of winning $5,000 for their school.
														</p>
														<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
														<p>We are a group from the L&N STEM Academy, a Knoxville magnet high school, participating in the CodeTN website design challenge.
															<br>Our members include:
															<li>Logan O’Neal - Back End Developer</li>
															<li>Tyler Duckworth - Front End Developer</li>
															<li>Jordan Drake - Art Designer</li>
															<li>Uziel Rodriguez - Marketer</li>
															<li>Gavin Endsley - Art Designer</li>
														</p>
														<h1>The Design Challenge?</h1>
														<p>We were tasked with designing a web app that solved an issue in our school, community, or world. For more information, click the link here to go to the CodeTN website.</p>
														<h1>Our Solution</h1>
														<p>Our solution was AllerGPS, an app that helps people with allergies find places to eat easily. This was chosen because of its prevalence in our world today. According to the CDC, the amount of children with food allergies has increaded by 50% in the past 10 years. Rather than letting children or their parents guess where it is OK to eat, our app gives them locations to go to, or avoid.</p>

													<h1>The Power of Decentralized Currency: How Cryptocurrency is Changing the Power Relationship Between Central Banks and Citizens</h1>						
													<div class="blog-detail">Research Project</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<p>Decentralized currencies in the form of cryptocurrency are gradually becoming an integral part of the global economy. Historically, countries have delegated central banks the task of managing the currency used within their geographic domain. In direct opposition to this concept, private decentralized trust networks known as cryptocurrencies have emerged. These currencies have the potential to serve as both a commodity and a currency and exist inherently so long as they have adequate users. While non-tender based commodities such as precious metals have been traditionally used in tandem with state-backed currency, signals suggest that cryptocurrency could eventually replace governmental “fiat currencies.” This substitution has the capability to fully decentralize an economy, freeing citizens and markets from monetary policies instituted by their nation’s central baking system. The transition from a centralized to decentralized economy will inevitably affect the power relationship between the central banks who control fiat currencies and the citizens who will no longer use them. This study examines this journey and provides insight into how cryptocurrency will disrupt how power manifests itself between citizens and the institutions that control them in order to create a clearer picture of what a completely decentralized, inherently more global economy will look like. This research is then used to answer how the transition from a fully centralized, fiat currency-based economy to a decentralized, cryptocurrency-based economy will affect the power relationship between a nation’s citizens and institutions of monetary control.<p></p> In order to properly talk about the implications of decentralized cryptocurrency, it is first necessary to clearly define what these currencies are because the term is somewhat nuanced. This paper focuses on the implications of blockchain-based decentralized currencies or 3 cryptocurrencies. These currencies first appeared in a 2008 paper authored under the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto was the brainchild behind the methodologies of the technology that eventually became the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin. He described bitcoin as a peer to peer decentralized currency system where each user contributes a form of “work” that gives the currency its value. I the Baltic Journal of Economic Studies, Mohilevskyi extends this definition claiming that a cryptocurrency is a “coin cryptographically protected against tampering” where “all information about transactions is stored in the blockchain system.” Nikitin, the CEO of a large cryptocurrency-based banking service, puts this definition into a geopolitical context claiming that cryptocurrency should not depend on any national currency and be purely peer to peer to ensure proper decentralization. Nikitin’s definition differentiates decentralized cryptocurrencies from centralized digital currencies currently being used in some countries, most notably within the US developed by large corporations This definition of a decentralized cryptocurrency will be used for the remainder of this paper. It is vital when distinguishing cryptocurrencies from digitized forms fiat and other centrally controlled currencies.<p></p> When analyzing how power manifests itself between central banks and citizens in instances where cryptocurrency functions as a primary currency, it is crucial to consider the legitimacy of this possibility and the steps that must be taken to achieve this transition. In its present form, within most developed economies, cryptocurrencies are treated as a commodity. In other words, this means that they are a material of value that can be bought and sold similarly to items such as precious metals, food, and oil. Only a select few developing countries who have undergone significant economic hardship have adopted cryptocurrencies as a primary form of currency. In order for cryptocurrencies to make the transition from a commodity to a primary form of currency, they must first meet all the required functions of money in a society. <p></p> The European Central Bank defines the three primary functions of money as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value (Gerdesmeier, 2009). For a currency to be considered a medium of exchange, its ease of use is a crucial factor. According to Nguyen, a cryptocurrency researcher, “money is used as an intermediary in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a barter system.” This means that currency should not add any additional “inconveniences” to transactions. Additionally, both parties must desire to possess the currency being used for the transaction; otherwise, it is worthless. Some have argued that since cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are not state-sponsored, they do not meet this criterion. This is false for two reasons. Firstly, blockchain technologies rely on proof of work, which gives them an inherent value so long as the technology's backbone remains secure. Secondly, the lack of state sponsorship increases the number of people who could potentially use these currencies since the currency’s functionality is no longer confined to any given geographic area. Therefore, for these reasons, “as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is used for transactions, and national backing should not be too strongly of a criterion for backing a currency” (Carrick, 2016). For a currency to be considered a unit of account it must be able to appraise all transactions. Since nearly all blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are finite and infinitely divisible, all transactions can be priced regardless of size (Carrick, 2016). Therefore, they fulfill the role as a unit of account since all goods, services, assets, and liabilities can be assigned a price regardless of individual values. For a currency to be a substantial store of value, as defined by the European Central Bank, it must be able to hold its value over time. At the present time, most cryptocurrencies are very volatile and should not be considered an adequate store of value and, therefore, do not meet this requirement (Heller, 2017). However, they can be used to offset risk due to their tendency to track markets inversely (Carrick, 2016). The ladder point is especially 5 significant in developing countries with risks resulting from government agencies. Due to this volatility level, which can be quite severe in some cases, most cryptocurrencies do not currently meet the third function of money as a store of value. Regardless of this fact, it is mathematically proven that volatility goes down as blockchain users increase; therefore, in the relative future, cryptocurrencies will meet the third function of money as a store of value so long as their popularity continues to rise at the present rate (Sichinava, 2019). Furthermore, historically when citizens have been given a choice between investing in a nationally backed fiat currency of an irresponsible regime or a volatile cryptocurrency, citizens have chosen the cryptocurrency. This has been observed in countries such as Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, where the country's fiat currency is also experiencing comparable, and often much more significant, levels of volatility (Mahdavieh, 2019).<p></p> The roles and decisions of central banks in the development of cryptocurrencies is vital. The decisions that legislatures make regarding the role of decentralized money will greatly affect the function of these currencies on a global scale. These decisions are a prerequisite for developing a common framework for regulating “quasi-money” (Krivoruchko, 2018). Thus far, central banks have taken varied positions regarding their approaches to regulating or deregulating these decentralized forms of currency. Most of these decisions can be clearly linked to the value and volatility of the given nation’s fiat currency. Countries with more unpredictable monetary systems tend to be more favorable of deregulation. Countries with less volatile fiat currencies tend to take one of two approaches. They either treat cryptocurrencies similarly to traded securities and implement a capital gains tax or treat them as a commodity such as gold and tax them at a typically much higher long-term capital gains rate (Raskin, 2019). <p></p>After the value of cryptocurrencies stabilizes and the third function of money is met as a substantial store of value, there is still a crucial roadblock on the path to cryptocurrency’s direct function as a primary currency. Financial intermediaries such as central banks currently hold power through their control of monetary systems. For this reason, since they value this power, these institutions must be adequately incentivized to forfeit their position to a decentralized system. In order for this to be successful, these incentives must directly motivate the banks themselves and the citizens of the countries that they control because, in democratic societies, the citizens typically have some level of power over their role in controlling the nation's legislation. From a citizen’s perspective, removing all institutional middlemen significantly lowers transactional costs and time, saving them money each time during every transaction. In addition, citizens gain an increased level of monetary stability due to the global scale of cryptocurrencies (Belke, 2020). This is because globalization insulates individual economies from local issues such as political unrest (Mohilevskyi, 2018). A citizen’s distrust in their government is mitigated because no government or central bank can directly control their money supply due to decentralization (Nguyen, 2019). These factors empower citizens by taking control away from legislatures and giving citizens power over their monetary systems. At its present state, cryptocurrency does not serve as a model proxy for fiat currency due to its high inflation rate. The relatively low level of cryptocurrencies being adopted as a primary currency can be attributed to this
														 volatility. In many cases, fiat money and decentralized currency's coexistence serves as a threat that keeps central banks in check because banks recognize how easily replaceable they are as institutions (Beretta, 2020). There is a significant amount of evidence that suggests that this system is preferable due to the increased criminal activity and fraud that has historically been observed in countries with fully cryptocurrency- 7 based economies end; however, the developing state of these countries should be considered. Eichengreen, an economist working for the National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that this two-party system will eventually converge into a middle ground in the form of a state-run centralized cryptocurrency-based system (2019). <p></p>This paper was written in the pursuit of predicting the most probable path that monetary institutions will take regarding their treatment of decentralized cryptocurrencies. Through considering the motivations of lawmakers, bankers, and citizens, a clearer picture can be gained as to how hierarchal power will shape the future of the technology. It is clear that those who currently hold a stake in monetary policy will favor command-and-control style regulation. In contrast, others who will be the primary users of the technology will favor monetary freedom due to the many economic and security-based invectives of decentralization. Regardless of its present state, in the future, as cryptocurrency gains a more extensive user pool, its value will inevitably stabilize and fully replace all forms of legal tender due to the many incentives that it offers. Realworld examples of this phenomenon have shown that the developed counties will most likely prefer a semi-decentralized model where regulators still have some power over the technology. These standards will be built in tandem with the growth of a cryptocurrency-based economy. Regardless of the decentralization level, this transition will take power away from central banks, legislatures, and governments and give power to citizens in the forms of monetary freedom, transactional privacy/security, and economic stability.</p>

													<h1>Installing Pytorch on Nvidia Jetson TX2</h1>						
													<div class="blog-detail">Poem</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<h1>Introduction</h1>
														<p>I am creating this tutorial after spending a large amount of time going through I tedious trial and error process while working to install Pytorch on the Jetson TX2. The same process should apply for the Nvidia Jetson Nano, TX1, and TK models (as long as you are using CUDA 10 which comes with the newest version of Nvidia Jetpack).</p>
														<h1>Recommendations</h1>
														<p>Ensure that your Jetson’s fan is running. If not, run <blockquote>$ sudo ~/jetson_clocks.sh</blockquote> or if on the most recent version of Jetpack (as of July 2019) run <blockquote>$ sudo /usr/bin/jetson_clocks</blockquote></p>
														<h1>Step 1: Clone Pytorch</h1>
														<p>Note: If you do not need the full pytorch install (for example you are using a very specfici pakcage) you do not need to include the –recursive flag. Instead clone normally and add the desired submodule manually.</p>
														<blockquote>
															$ mkdir [install location]<br>
															$ cd [install location]<br>
															$ git clone --recursive ttp://github.com/pytorch/pytorch<br>
															$ cd pytorch<br>
														</blockquote>
														<h1>Step 2: Set Environment Variables for Installation</h1>
														<blockquote>
															$ export USE_NCCL=0<br>
															$ export USE_DISTRIBUTED=0<br>
															$ export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="5.3;6.2;7.2"<br>
														</blockquote>
														<h1>Step 3: Install Dependencies</h1>
														<blockquote>
															$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip cmake<br>
															$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U pip<br>
															$ sudo python3 -m install -U setuptools<br>
															$ sudo python3 -m install -r requirements.txt<br>
															$ sudo python3 -m pip install scikit-build --user<br>
															$ sudo python3 -m pip install ninja --useri<br>
														</blockquote>
														<h1>Step 4: Configure and Install Pytorch</h1>
														<p>This will take a long time (typically around 4-5 hours)</p>
														<blockquote>
															$ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel<br>
															$ sudo python3 setup.py install --user<br>
														</blockquote>

													<h1>Should Artificial Intelligence be Regulated?</h1>						
													<div class="blog-detail">Essay</div>
													<div class="blog-content">
														<p>
															People tend to fear things that they themselves can not control or do not understand. Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a prime example of this. In recent years there has been an increase in the usage of AI which has made many people skeptical of its potential. While artificial intelligence does not currently pose an imminent threat to society it should be regulated. It is the responsibility of both developers and legislatures to do so. Each group within their own spheres of jurisdiction.
														</p>
														<p>
															According to “The Artificial Intelligence Act of 2017–2018”, artificial intelligence is “Any artificial systems that perform tasks under varying and unpredictable circumstances, without significant human oversight, or that can learn from their experience and improve their performance.” This includes, “Systems that think like humans, such as cognitive architectures and neural networks” (H. 4625, 2017). The bill also mentions that any system that passes the Turing test is to be considered artificial intelligence. The Turing test requires the machine to be indistinguishable from a human when asked a series of questions. Legislatures disagree as to whether artificial intelligence can be safely used, whether we can trust the neural network technology itself, and whether it can be safely controlled. Some lawmakers, who want to protect the freedoms of the developers say that “the futuristic fear of existential risks does not justify the overall regulation of development” (Wallach 1).
														</p>
														<p>
															Both parties bring some key points to the table. While artificial intelligence is a threat and could eventually lead to catastrophe, it is also an amazing technology with countless applications. According to Finale Doshi-Velez in “Artificial intelligence is more powerful than ever. How do we hold it accountable?”, artificial intelligence is “used for tasks such as analyzing MRIs, giving financial advice and even composing music.” With all of these amazing applications, it would be a shame to put an end to the development of artificial intelligence entirely.
														</p>
														<p>Artificial intelligence poses a number of risks to our society. These risks can be put into three main groups: national security and safety, job markets, and the inevitable singularity instance. Over time as technology gets more advanced, one or a combination of all three events could lead to the eventual downfall of society. For this reason, legislatures must regulate artificial intelligence.														</p>
														<p>Many people fear the use of “human out of the loop” systems where a robot could make life or death decisions. Systems like these could create a national security concern and lead many to question the ethics of the military. Should a robot be given the power to take a life without human consent? Wendell Wallach in “Eyes on AI” makes the point that, “Current learning systems are black boxes, whose output can be biased, whose reasoning cannot be explained, and whose impact cannot always be controlled.” Furthermore, many developers believe that “black box” technologies such as artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly abstract and harder to control. Doshi-Velez, Finale, and Mason Kortz in “Artificial intelligence is more powerful than ever. How do we hold it accountable?” help to further explain this point when they say that, “algorithms, especially those developed using advanced machine learning techniques, like deep neural networks, can be so complex that not even the designers fully understand how they make decisions.” For these reasons, some lawmakers believe the answer is no, robots should not be able to take a life, and are lobbying for “human in the loop” regulations. Others say that regulation of AI in the military would prevent the US from competing with other countries. Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, says that, “Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world”. The next space race is artificial intelligence. Legislatures must create laws that enable companies to compete on an international scale while protecting American interests.</p>
														<p>Experts predict that one third of today’s jobs will be replaced with robots by the year 2025. This includes machines that do not use AI technology. In, “Tech companies should stop pretending AI won’t destroy jobs”, Kai-FU Lee says that “AI will displace a large number of jobs, which will cause social discontent.” Lee predicts that in the future it may become normal to be unemployed. Some legislatures have proposed a universal basic income for those who have had there jobs taken by robots (Lee 3). In America especially, public skepticism of mass job loss has led many groups to lobby for the ban of AI technologies. Kai-Fu Lee says that, “Truckers are now appealing to President Donald Trump and Congress to stop testing of autonomous trucks.” It is complications such as this that have allowed countries such as China to surpass the US in the development of artificial intelligence.</p>
														<p>According to Amitai Etzioni in “Should artificial intelligence be regulated?” the singularity instance will occur “after reaching a point of ‘technological singularity,’ computers will continue to advance and give birth to rapid technological progress that will result in dramatic and unpredictable changes for humanity”. Amitai Etzioni also makes the point that “AI is on the path to turning robots into a master class that will subjugate humanity, if not destroy it.” Essentially, the fear is that artificial intelligence in pair with a rapid growth in computing power will allow robots to overtake mankind. Some people may immediately dismiss this claim as science fiction. Others, especially those who work in the tech industry, see the singularity instance as a real threat and are pushing for regulation.</p>
														<p>Accidents are inevitable, especially those relating to a technology as volatile as artificial intelligence. An autonomous Uber manufactured by Forb in pair with Argo AI recently struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona (Doshi-Velez 3). This incident caused many to lose their trust in AI. In mere seconds trust that was gained after years of development, and eventually led lawmakers to allow fully autonomous vehicles to travel on roads was lost. In order to protect the future of artificial intelligence lawmakers must dismiss freak accidents such as this and focus on all of the good that AI has in store.</p>
														<p>It is the technology industry’s duty to use artificial intelligence responsibly.</p>
														<p>It is the programmer as an individual’s duty to never do unethical tasks even if their employer assigns it to them. Nevertheless, it is the duty of the tech industry to defend its freedom to create new technologies despite the public’s skepticism. Accordingly, if the groups abide by these roles there will be balance throughout the industry.</p>
														<p>Currently, legislators rely on laws, regulations, and industry oversight in order to regulate AI. This approach is inadequate and will soon become nullified. It is not the responsibility of the lawmakers to understand AI. This duty should be left to the developers. It is the lawmakers’ duty to create “An enforcement regime to ensure that industry acts responsibly and that critical standards are followed will also be required” (Wallach 1). The lawmakers job is not to directly regulate artificial intelligence. The lawmakers must put laws into place that hold the technology industry accountable and must avoid hindering development.</p>
														<p>It is the responsibility of both the programmer and the legislators to regulate artificial intelligence. While technological advances will require the government to further regulate artificial intelligence, it is the job of the programmers to protect the future of technology from tyranny. The current generation will be the remembered by future generations for their advances in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers and developers must reach a consensus as to where to draw the line between freedom and security.</p>
